# train.py

# This file contains the main training loop.
# This file should include:

# 1. Set up configuration
#    - Parse command-line arguments or load config file
#    - Set hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs, etc.)
#    - Configure device (CPU/GPU)

# 2. Model initialization
#    - Initialize the PortraitNet model
#    - Move model to appropriate device (CPU/GPU)

# 3. Training loop
#    - Iterate through epochs

# 4. Model evaluation
#    - Evaluate final model performance 

# 5. Save trained model
#    - Save final model weights and architecture


# Usage:
# python train.py --config path/to/config.yaml
